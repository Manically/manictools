The tool automatically downloads some existing Ninite installers, and gives the option to run them. The two other options allow running Chris Titus' Windows Utilities (WinUtils) and to run Massgrave's Windows Activation Scripts (I do not condone nor encourage the misuse of these scripts. Any damage done to your computer is your own doing. Also, only use these if you have bought Windows!).


All of the scripts and installers provided via this program are not written by me nor do I associate with anyone who wrote them. Run at your own risk. 
The places to access the scripts in my tool are listed below:

Installers were all created through [Ninite](https://ninite.com/).
Titus WinUtils can be found [here](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil/)
Massgrave Windows Activation Scripts can be found [here](https://massgrave.dev/)

You can find a version of the script that updates itself by referencing this repository and references to this GitHub page [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/bvf4x99bhla3di9/manictools.exe/file)
